## Background Color Changer!

This web page has one button "change color".  When you click it, it us supposed to cycle endlessly through the colors of the rainbow, affectionately known as [Roy G. Biv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROYGBIV).  


### Specification
1. Page starts as white
2. Clicking "change color" should change the background to Red
3. Clicking "change color" again should change the background to Orange
4. Keep following the sequence every time the "change color" button is clicked.  When you get to the end of the sequence, Violet, clicking "change color" again should change the color back to Red, and the seqence should start again.

### Bug
After the sequence gets to Violet, it is supposed to go back to Red, but there is a bug!  It stays on Violet.

### Your task
Using the instructions for [Mr. Potato Head](https://github.com/slackhappy/Mr_Potato_Head/blob/master/README.md) as a guide:

1. fork this repository
2. clone it in c9
3. find the bug
4. fix it!
5. commit your fix and send a pull request


### Bonus
Once you fix the bug, you'll have ROYGBIVROYGBIVROYGBIV....  Can you have the color sequence reverse direction at each end, like this: ROYGBIVIBGYOROYGBIVIBGYOR...  ?
